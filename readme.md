Meanings is a lightweight dictionary extension built with React and TypeScript. It allows you to search for English words and get detailed definitions, phonetic, and pronunciation audios using a clean and accessible UI. The extension integrates with a custom FastAPI backend to fetch dictionary data dynamically. See it here [Dictionary Api](https://github.com/skyx20/cambridge_api).

This program uses WXT next-gen framework for quick development of browser extensions. Ideal for language learners, students, and anyone who wants quick access to word meanings without leaving their current tab.

### API

The api endpoint is in `background.ts` file to fetch the word data

### How to install

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/skyx20/dictionary-extension.git`
